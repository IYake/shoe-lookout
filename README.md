# shoe-lookout
A bot to help order the latest men's Nike shoes before they sell out.

# How does it work?
The Python script continuously checks the Nike website if the new shoe is available, and when it is, the bot logs in, saves the product to your wishlist and then emails you that it's inside your wishlist. Then you can buy it from your phone (which hopefully gets email notifications).

# Who is it for?
It's for [IYake](https://github.com/IYake) and [DevinSuttles](https://github.com/DevinSuttles), but anyone else can use it. Just modify the text file and make an email account for your own bot.

# How to use it?
Download the code, the chrome driver (change the filepath), the appropriate modules, and change the text file. If you're interested in women's new shoes, just find the corresponding new women's shoes link and order it by newest.
